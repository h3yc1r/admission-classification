# admission-classification
A machine learning project to classify university admission chances based on academic features. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

# Admission Classification

This project predicts the admission chances of students based on their academic using machine learning classification algorithms.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:
- GRE Score
- TOEFL Score
- University Rating
- Statement of Purpose (SOP)
- Letter of Recommendation (LOR)
- CGPA
- Research Experience

> 📁 The dataset is assumed to be locally available as `admission_data.csv`.

## 🧠 Project Steps

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Feature Scaling  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. jupyter notebook admission_classification.ipynb

📌 Results
The best model achieved a classification accuracy of approximately 97.5%
